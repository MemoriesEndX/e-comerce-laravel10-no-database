# E-Commerce Laravel 10 (No Database)

This is a simple e-commerce project built using Laravel 10 without a database. It is designed to demonstrate the fundamental concepts of developing an e-commerce application with Laravel, such as routing, controllers, and data handling, without relying on a database.

## Key Features
- **Dummy Product Data**: Product data is stored directly in arrays or configuration files, instead of using a database.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handles pages such as product listings, product details, shopping cart, and checkout.
- **Shopping Cart**: Stores cart data using Laravel's session system.
- **Simple Checkout**: Simulates a basic checkout process without real transactions.
- **Modular Design**: The project structure follows Laravel's best practices for easy future enhancements.

 Technologies
- Laravel 10: A modern PHP framework used to build the application.
- Blade Template Engine: For efficient management of the application's frontend views.
- Session Managemen*: Used to store temporary data like the shopping cart.

How to Use
1. Clone the Repositor:

   git clone https://github.com/username/e-commerce-laravel10-no-database.git
   cd e-commerce-laravel10-no-database

2. Install Dependencies:
   Run the following command to install Laravel dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
3. Start the Laravel Server:
   Use the following command to start the development server:
  
   php artisan serve
  
4. Access the Application:
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

Folder Structure
- routes/web.php**: Defines routes for the e-commerce pages.
- app/Http/Controllers/**: Contains logic for displaying products and managing the cart.
- resources/views/**: Contains Blade template files for the application's frontend.
- storage/framework/sessions**: Stores session data (e.g., shopping cart).

 Notes
This project is designed to run without a database, meaning all data is stored in arrays or sessions. If you decide to integrate a database in the future, the project's structure is already compatible with Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
